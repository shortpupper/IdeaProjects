## Features
 These are the features.

 ### Backpacks
 #### plans
  Make it configurable for amount of space so,
  if in the config it is:
  ```yaml
  Max_Backpack_size: 54
  ```
  then you could change it to 127, and it would have pages. 
  So I would have to rewrite the backpack gui, fix the fact that you
  can't have it in your offhand, etc.
 #### Right now
  backpacks right now are needed to be paid for to use going to fix that
  later.

### Quests

 Quest there are only two of them, and im making a gui for it.
